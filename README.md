Developers: check the file developer-guide.txt here in the root.
Also, remember the following conventions, as they're not the Java norms:

Opening braces should be on the next line.
Method names, when possible, should use UpperCamelCase.
Please, for the sake of everything, indent your lines with either a tab or 4 spaces. Seriously.
