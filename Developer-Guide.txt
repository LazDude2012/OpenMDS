Welcome to the OpenMDS team!

Here are the basics of how OpenMDS works internally:

Each defensive item you'd like to add can have a list of "priorities". What does this mean? I'll explain in a second.
The Defence Computer, the base for all defence systems, holds Attunements, in the form of Attunement Crystals. (or technically anything
that implements IAttunable)

Basically, when writing an attachment, you need to have your priorities sent to the computer, which then matches them with
attunements. These attunements can then be retrieved by your attachment and used.\

Priorities are a way to specify what your attachment does to players with matching attunements. Turrets might shoot some and let others by,
force fields may let some pass through, etc.

How do I use attunements?
Basically, attunements are super-simple. Just check if a player's inventory contains an IAtttunable with the same attunement, and if so, perform
your desired action.

Please implement I6WayWrenchable in your tile entities; this way, we can rotate your blocks with the Defence Spanner.
