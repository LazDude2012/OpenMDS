Welcome to the OpenMDS team!

Here are the basics of how OpenMDS works internally:

Each defensive item you'd like to add can have a list of "priorities". What does this mean? I'll explain in a second.
The Defence Computer, the base for all defence systems, holds Attunements, in the form of Attunement Crystals. (or technically anything
that implements IAttunable)

Basically, when writing an attachment, you need to have your priorities sent to the computer, which then matches them with
attunements. These attunements can then be retrieved by your attachment and used.

How do I use attunements?
Basically, attunements are super-simple. Just check if a player's inventory contains an IAtttunable with the same attunement, and if so, perform
your desired action.

Please implement I6WayWrenchable in your tile entities; this way, we can rotate your blocks with the Defence Spanner.
