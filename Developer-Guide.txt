Welcome to the OpenMDS team!

This repo should be cloned to the /src/minecraft folder of your MCP installation
"cd <YOURMCPFOLDERHERE>/src/minecraft"
"git clone https://github.com/LazDude2012/OpenMDS.git"

Here are the basics of how OpenMDS works internally:

Each defensive item should have at least 1 inventory slot for attunement items. (Right now that's just the attunement crystal, but you'll be able to make attuned armour in future versions)

How do I use attunements?
Basically, attunements are super-simple. Just check if a player's inventory contains an IAtttunable with the same attunement, and if so, perform
your desired action.

Please implement I6WayWrenchable in your tile entities; this way, we can rotate your blocks with the Defence Spanner.
